% Contributing to TokTok

This document serves as a non-binding simpler version of the [Contributor
License Agreement](cla). Any errors in or misinterpretations of the following
text have no legal effect. See CLA for the real thing that you can feed to
[lawyer cats](http://www.legalcheek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lawyer-cat1.jpg).

# Definitions

- "We" is toktok-team.
- "You" is you, the person who submits code to GitHub.
- "Contribution" is the code or documentation you wrote, pictures you drew, etc.
- "Copyright" is [this scary thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright).
- "Material" is the project you're submitting contributions to.
- "Submit" is making a pull request on our GitHub repository.
- "Submission Date" is the date on which you made the PR.
- "Effective Date" is there so you can sign the CLA and it retroactively
  applies to past contributions you made before signing it.

# Grant of Rights

## Copyright License

(a) You keep the Copyright.

(b) We can relicense the whole project (e.g. when someone like Apple requires
us to be less copy-lefty). We can not change the license of older code (it
stays under whatever license it was), but we can change it for future
versions. See 2.3 for what kind of licenses we can use (spoiler alert: only
FOSS licenses).

## Patent License

If your code is patented, you need to have the right to give us a patent
license, and you do that by signing the CLA. Also, if you file patents about
your contribution in the future, we get a license. This is so we don't need to
suddenly pay you when you realise you made something really cool and you must
now make money off of it.

## Outbound License

This section promises that we only use FSF-approved licenses. Basically, this
promises that we won't make your code proprietary.

## Moral Rights

TokTok (and Tox in general) wants to give everybody in the world privacy. Your
contribution helps us achieve that goal. Everybody includes bad people, so our
work will benefit them, too. This section means that if you later feel bad and
don't want to help bad people anymore, and you feel that monitoring and
tracking all citizens is a good thing, then you can't force us to stop and you
can't revoke your contribution.

## Our Rights

We may or may not use your contribution, that's up to us.

## Reservation of Rights

You keep all the rights you didn't license to us.

# Agreement

You confirm that:

(a) You're allowed to sign the CLA.

(b) You actually own what you give us (no cheating).

(c) If you're not allowed to sign the CLA, someone who is should do it (e.g.
parents or employer).

(d) You've talked to us if you don't own the whole contribution yourself (e.g.
you made it together with a friend).

# Disclaimer

You don't give us any warranties for the contribution other than the ones in
section 3. So, for example you're not claiming that the code you wrote is
useful or safe. Hopefully it is, but you can't be sued if it's not.

# Consequential Damage Waiver

If your code is crap and people lose money or data because of it, you won't be
sued.

# Miscellaneous

## Legislation

TokTok is legally based in the United Kingdom, so the UK laws apply to this
agreement.

## Other agreements

There are no other agreements, only
~~[ZUUL](http://onqny.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/the-gatekeeper.png)~~CLA.
Things we agree on via IRC or otherwise are not legally binding.

## Third parties

If toktok-team gets a new member, that person needs to promise (in writing) to
follow the rules in the CLA. If you transfer Copyright to someone else, they
also need to promise that.

## Failure of performance

If we break the rules and you don't sue us, that doesn't mean we get free pass
to do whatever we like. If we break the rules again, you can still sue. The
same applies to you breaking the rules.

If it's necessary to break the rules, we can have an external agreement for
one time, but after that, the CLA rules apply again.

## Enforcability

If the CLA is partially void because of some laws, that doesn't mean the whole
agreement is void, only that part. Also, that part will be enforced as much as
possible using other rules that are close to its intent.

## Changes to the Agreement

If the CLA changes, it doesn't affect you, unless you sign the new one as well.
The git history shows when you signed, so we can always tell which CLA was in
effect at that time. CLA assistant also keeps track of this, and we
periodically mirror that information as a CSV in the website repo.
