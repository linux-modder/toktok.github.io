      <main>
        <p>This document serves as a non-binding simpler version of the <a href="cla">Contributor License Agreement</a>. Any errors in or misinterpretations of the following text have no legal effect. See CLA for the real thing that you can feed to <a href="http://www.legalcheek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lawyer-cat1.jpg">lawyer cats</a>.</p>
<h1 id="definitions"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Definitions</h1>
<ul>
<li>“We” is toktok-team.</li>
<li>“You” is you, the person who submits code to GitHub.</li>
<li>“Contribution” is the code or documentation you wrote, pictures you drew, etc.</li>
<li>“Copyright” is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">this scary thing</a>.</li>
<li>“Material” is the project you’re submitting contributions to.</li>
<li>“Submit” is making a pull request on our GitHub repository.</li>
<li>“Submission Date” is the date on which you made the PR.</li>
<li>“Effective Date” is there so you can sign the CLA and it retroactively applies to past contributions you made before signing it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="grant-of-rights"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Grant of Rights</h1>
<h2 id="copyright-license"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Copyright License</h2>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>You keep the Copyright.</p></li>
<li><p>We can relicense the whole project (e.g. when someone like Apple requires us to be less copy-lefty). We can not change the license of older code (it stays under whatever license it was), but we can change it for future versions. See 2.3 for what kind of licenses we can use (spoiler alert: only FOSS licenses).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="patent-license"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Patent License</h2>
<p>If your code is patented, you need to have the right to give us a patent license, and you do that by signing the CLA. Also, if you file patents about your contribution in the future, we get a license. This is so we don’t need to suddenly pay you when you realise you made something really cool and you must now make money off of it.</p>
<h2 id="outbound-license"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Outbound License</h2>
<p>This section promises that we only use FSF-approved licenses. Basically, this promises that we won’t make your code proprietary.</p>
<h2 id="moral-rights"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Moral Rights</h2>
<p>TokTok (and Tox in general) wants to give everybody in the world privacy. Your contribution helps us achieve that goal. Everybody includes bad people, so our work will benefit them, too. This section means that if you later feel bad and don’t want to help bad people anymore, and you feel that monitoring and tracking all citizens is a good thing, then you can’t force us to stop and you can’t revoke your contribution.</p>
<h2 id="our-rights"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Our Rights</h2>
<p>We may or may not use your contribution, that’s up to us.</p>
<h2 id="reservation-of-rights"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Reservation of Rights</h2>
<p>You keep all the rights you didn’t license to us.</p>
<h1 id="agreement"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Agreement</h1>
<p>You confirm that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>You’re allowed to sign the CLA.</p></li>
<li><p>You actually own what you give us (no cheating).</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re not allowed to sign the CLA, someone who is should do it (e.g. parents or employer).</p></li>
<li><p>You’ve talked to us if you don’t own the whole contribution yourself (e.g. you made it together with a friend).</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="disclaimer"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Disclaimer</h1>
<p>You don’t give us any warranties for the contribution other than the ones in section 3. So, for example you’re not claiming that the code you wrote is useful or safe. Hopefully it is, but you can’t be sued if it’s not.</p>
<h1 id="consequential-damage-waiver"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Consequential Damage Waiver</h1>
<p>If your code is crap and people lose money or data because of it, you won’t be sued.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2 id="legislation"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Legislation</h2>
<p>TokTok is legally based in the United Kingdom, so the UK laws apply to this agreement.</p>
<h2 id="other-agreements"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Other agreements</h2>
<p>There are no other agreements, only <del><a href="http://onqny.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/the-gatekeeper.png">ZUUL</a></del>CLA. Things we agree on via IRC or otherwise are not legally binding.</p>
<h2 id="third-parties"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Third parties</h2>
<p>If toktok-team gets a new member, that person needs to promise (in writing) to follow the rules in the CLA. If you transfer Copyright to someone else, they also need to promise that.</p>
<h2 id="failure-of-performance"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Failure of performance</h2>
<p>If we break the rules and you don’t sue us, that doesn’t mean we get free pass to do whatever we like. If we break the rules again, you can still sue. The same applies to you breaking the rules.</p>
<p>If it’s necessary to break the rules, we can have an external agreement for one time, but after that, the CLA rules apply again.</p>
<h2 id="enforcability"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Enforcability</h2>
<p>If the CLA is partially void because of some laws, that doesn’t mean the whole agreement is void, only that part. Also, that part will be enforced as much as possible using other rules that are close to its intent.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-the-agreement"><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Changes to the Agreement</h2>
<p>If the CLA changes, it doesn’t affect you, unless you sign the new one as well. The git history shows when you signed, so we can always tell which CLA was in effect at that time. CLA assistant also keeps track of this, and we periodically mirror that information as a CSV in the website repo.</p>
