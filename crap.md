First, let's talk about the world we live in.  We see privacy constantly being
[undermined](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/03/13/uk-government-going-beyond-fbi-wants-apple/),
surveillance being restlessly increased, and public opinion sneakily being
[influenced](http://news.163.com/16/0305/15/BHDEK9K50001124J.html) by
government agencies. People [don't seem to

[warnings](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en)

Targeted advertising is becoming more and more powerful, due to the precise
profiles built of every individual. These profiles help future and past leaders
gain Even in today's world, companies and governments have, with their very
limited insight into our lives, incredibly accurate models to predict each
individual's behaviour. With advancing machine learning methods, we can more
and more accurately predict people's desires, thoughts, and dislikes, and
target campaigns to them.
